Mini-Editor:
	A minimalist text editor that uses the concepts of linked-lists and buffers to provide a mostly functional text editor that operates within the Terminal console window itself, without any external
libraries being used. 

	This editor is complete with robust file handling, substring searching within text files, and undo and redo functions.
